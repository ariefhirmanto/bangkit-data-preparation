# Data Preparation on Titanic Dataset
Example of data preparation for Google Bangkit Assessment for Data Preparation Machine Learning.
In this example, we will prepare Titanic dataset into the kind of data that machine learning algorithm can train.  
There's some major step for this:
 * Peek the dataset and know what kind of data in it
 * Extract the information / Drop the data that we don't need
 * Check for empty value in dataset, we can fill it or either drop all the column (if we don't need the information in the column)
 * Transform categorical data into numerical value
<br>With the above mentioned step already taken, this Titanic dataset can be trained by Machine Learning algorithm.
